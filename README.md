# Search Pinned Tabs addon
For those of you who have a huge number of pinned tabs and need a way to navigate quickly

This addon is based on the tabs-tabs-tabs example addon provided by Mozilla. Please refer to [link](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/tree/master/tabs-tabs-tabs) for more info.

I made this in a few hours, so its nowhere close to good. But it solved my problem. Always scope for improvement.

# TODO
  * Build a better UI
  * Remove unwanted code
  * Add an icon for the extension
  * Test on lower memory systems. My assumption is you would use this extension only if you were able to pin more than 100 tabs.
